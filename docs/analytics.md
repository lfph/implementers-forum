# Analytics and Efficacy

This is a compilation of documentation available on how different countries approach analytics and telemetry of their apps and how they use that data to inform the potential efficacy of the exposure notification technology.

## ENPA

If you are running ENX, please contact your Google and Apple developer relations teams about enrolling in ENPA. For those setting up ENPA, we strongly recommend including the opt-in for analytics to your current app sign-up process, even if you are not yet enrolled in ENPA. Having pre-authorization for anonymous, aggregated analytics will help you collect better information faster so you can adjust your system moving forward.

More information coming soon. 

## Analytics Resources

* **Italy**
    * This [detailed description](https://github.com/immuni-app/immuni-documentation/blob/master/Privacy-Preserving%20Analytics.md) covers how the Italians were able to implement analytics in a secure fashion to both maintain user privacy and server data integrity.
* **Switzerland**
    * Their [website](https://www.experimental.bfs.admin.ch/expstat/en/home/innovative-methods/swisscovid-app-monitoring.html) shows app analytics, including downloads, active users, and covid codes entered.
* **Ireland**
    * From the [GAEN Symposium](https://github.com/lfph/events/tree/master/2020-07-GAEN-Symposium), a [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j0weRzYIsnM&list=PLLUsXRAaict7U00sMcwdLWwPPfRwpnMs5&index=4) discussion about the production and analytics of the COVID Green app in use by Ireland, Gibraltar, Pennsylvania, New York, and others.

* **England and Wales**
    * [The epidemiological impact of the NHS COVID-19 app](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-021-03606-z): A thorough study on the estimated number of cases averted and lives saved by the NHS exposure notification app. 
* **Washington, US**
    * [Early Epidemiological Evidence of Public Health Value of WA Notify, a Smartphone-based Exposure Notification Tool: Modeling COVID-19 Cases Averted in Washington State](https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.06.04.21257951): They assessed the impact of Washington Stateâ€™s exposure notification tool, WA Notify, in mitigating the spread of COVID-19 during its first four months of implementation.
* **Spain**
    * [A population-based controlled experiment assessing the epidemiological impact of digital contact tracing](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-020-20817-6): "After a substantial communication campaign, we estimate that at least 33% of the population adopted the technology and further showed relatively high adherence and compliance as well as a quick turnaround time."
* **Switzerland**
    * The Swiss put out a [detailed report](https://github.com/digitalepidemiologylab/swisscovid_efficacy/blob/master/SwissCovid_efficacy_MS.pdf) covering how they are able to measure the efficacy of the app and showing initial results.
